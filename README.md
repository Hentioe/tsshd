# tsshd

The [`tssh --udp`](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh) works like [`mosh`](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh), and the `tsshd` works like `mosh-server`.

## Advanced Features

- Low latency ( based on kcp )

- Port forwarding ( same as ssh )

## How to use

1. Install [tssh](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh) on the client ( the user's machine ).

2. Install [tsshd](https://github.com/trzsz/tsshd) on the server ( the remote host ).

3. Use `tssh --udp xxx` to login to the server. Configure as follows to omit `--udp`:

   ```
   Host xxx
       #!! UdpMode yes
       #!! TsshdPath ~/go/bin/tsshd
   ```

## How it works

The `tssh` plays the role of `ssh` on the client side, and the `tsshd` plays the role of `sshd` on the server side.

The `tssh` will first login to the server normally as an ssh client, and then run a new `tsshd` process on the server.

The `tsshd` process listens on a random udp port between 61000 and 62000, and sends its port number and a secret key back to the `tssh` process over the ssh channel. The ssh connection is then shut down, and the `tssh` process communicates with the `tsshd` process over udp.
